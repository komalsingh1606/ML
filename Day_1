-> Machine learning is like teaching a computer to learn from examples and experiences, just like humans do. Instead of programming specific instructions for every task, 
we give the computer data and let it find patterns and make its own decisions. It's like teaching a child to recognize different animals by showing them pictures and letting 
them figure out the differences on their own. In machine learning, algorithms use this data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

-> Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. 
It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", 
to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, 
such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

->  Machine Learning is a form of artificial intelligence that teaches computers to learn and make decisions from data. 
Unlike traditional programming, which requires explicit rule definitions for every possible scenario, ML enables algorithms to identify patterns in data and learn on their own. 
This capability is crucial for complex tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing, where defining explicit rules would be an overly complex and lengthy task.
