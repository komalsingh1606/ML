-> Machine learning is like teaching a computer to learn from examples and experiences, just like humans do. Instead of programming specific instructions for every task, 
we give the computer data and let it find patterns and make its own decisions. It's like teaching a child to recognize different animals by showing them pictures and letting 
them figure out the differences on their own. In machine learning, algorithms use this data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

-> Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. 
It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", 
to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, 
such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

->  Imagine you want to teach a computer how to recognize whether a fruit is an apple or an orange. Instead of giving it a long list of rules like "if it's red and round, it's an apple," 
you could show it many pictures of different fruits, some apples, some oranges, and tell it which is which.

After seeing lots of examples, the computer starts to notice patterns on its own. Maybe it learns that most apples are red or green, while oranges are typically orange. 
It might also be learned that apples are usually round with a small dimple on top, while oranges are rounder with a bumpy surface.

Now, when you show it a new fruit it hasn't seen before, it can use what it learned from the examples to make a guess. If it's round, red, and has a dimple, it will likely guess it's an apple. 
If it's orange and has a bumpy surface, it will guess it's an orange.

This is similar to how machine learning works in real life. We give the computer lots of data (like pictures of fruits) and let it find patterns and make predictions on its own, 
without explicitly telling it what to look for.
